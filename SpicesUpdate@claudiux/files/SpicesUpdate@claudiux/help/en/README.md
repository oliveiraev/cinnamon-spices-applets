# Spices Update

## Summary

Cinnamon Spices are Applets, Desklets, Extensions and Themes.

You usually check updates for the Spices using Cinnamon Settings. But, like me,
you do it too seldom.

The **Spices Update** applet plays these roles:

- It warns you when the Spices you have installed need updates.
- Optional: It can also warn you when new Spices are available.
- It gives you direct access to Cinnamon Settings for Applets, Desklets,
  Extensions and Themes.
- It allows you to renew the download of the latest version of a Spice (only
  with Cinnamon 4.2 and following).

## Status

Usable from Cinnamon 2.8 to Cinnamon 4.2.

Fully supported by the author, under continuing development and in continuous
use on several machines, running with **Linux Mint**, **Fedora** or
**Archlinux**.

From version v3.0.0 ~ 20190808:

- Spices Update is compatible with Cinnamon 2.8 -> 4.2 (Mint 17.3 -> 19.2).
- From Cinnamon 3.8 to 4.2 (Mint 19 -> 19.2): **Perfectly functional, as
  usual.**
- From Cinnamon 2.8 to 3.6 (Mint 17.3 -> 18.3): Some features are reduced:
  - The Spices configuration window does not open on the second tab, only on the
    first one. You will need to click on the second tab and select the sort by
    date yourself.
  - The Settings window of this applet does not contain any tabs.
  - In the settings of this applet, you can not access Spices lists to disable
    their monitoring. Therefore, all installed Spices are monitored.
  - The script `generate_mo.sh` (in the `scripts` folder) allows you to install
    all available translations. Restart Cinnamon after execution.
  - If the `Symbola_Hinted` font can not be automatically installed, then place
    you into the `fonts/symbola` folder and double-click on the
    `Symbola_Hinted.ttf` file. Install it with the just opened
    `gnome-font-viewer`.
  - Cinnamon 2.8: The number of changes does not appear next to the Spices
    Update icon.

## Requirements

The Spices Update requires the `notify-send` tool and the `symbola` TrueType
font.

To install them:

- Fedora: `sudo dnf install libnotify gdouros-symbola-fonts`
- Arch:
  - `sudo pacman -Syu libnotify`
  - `yay -S ttf-symbola` _or_ `pamac build ttf-symbola`
- Linux Mint, Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libnotify-bin fonts-symbola`
- Debian (without sudo):
  - `su`
  - `apt install libnotify-bin fonts-symbola`

**This applet helps you to install these dependencies, if needed.**

## Settings

There are five tabs in settings.

The first, _General_, allows you to:

- Select the _Time interval between two checks_ (in hours). Please note that the
  first check will take place one minute after starting this applet.
- Select the ways to warn you : changing the appearance (by color changing) of
  the icon of this applet and/or displaying messages in the notification zone.
  You can also choose the type of notification: Minimal or With a button to open
  the Download tab in System Settings. If desired, the notification may contain
  the description of each update or new Spice.
- Select the _Type of display_ of the icon: with or without text?
- Hide the icon applet while nothing is to report. _Please note that Spices
  Update settings are only accessible when the applet icon is visible or by
  opening the Cinnamon Settings-> Applets._

For the content of the other tabs (_Applets_, _Desklets_, etc), please look at
the screenshot above and note that **the list of installed Spices is
automatically filled** at startup, but a button allows you to reload it.

Set to _FALSE_ (or uncheck the first box of) all the Spices you _do not want_ to
check updates. There are two reasons to do this:

- A spice is OK for you, and you do not want to be notified of any changes to
  it.
- You are a developer working on a spice and you do not want to be informed
  about changes during development.

From Cinnamon 4.2, you can request to renew the download of the latest version
of a Spice checking both boxes then clicking the Refresh button.

## Menu

In the menu of this applet:

- a Refresh button allows you to force checking the availability of updates for
  your Spices;
- a dot appears in front of each type of Spice when at least one update is
  available;
- a click on a type of Spice (Applets, Desklets, etc) opens the Download tab of
  the corresponding page in Cinnamon Settings, with Spices sorted by date;
- when new Spices are available, an option _Forget new Spices_ appears; clicking
  it will clear these notifications of new spices, until others arrive;
- a Configure... button opens the Settings.

## Icon

The color of the icon changes when at least one of your Spices needs an update.

From Cinnamon 4.2 (and Spices Update v4.1.0), the color of the icon darkens
while data are being refreshed.

Its tooltip (the message displayed when the icon is hovered) contains the list
of spices to update, if any.

## Notifications

There are two types of notifications: _Minimal_ or _With buttons_. Each of them
may or may not contain details: the reason for an update or the description of a
new spice.

### Minimal notifications

Here with the reason for update:

### Notifications with buttons

Two buttons: firstly a button to open the System Settings page to download
updates; secondly a button to refresh notifications.
